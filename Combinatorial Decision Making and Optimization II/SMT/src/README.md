The notebook can be run locally with jupyter installed or from colab on the following link: [Remote Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v0OPO9WZGsu8hdJvgs1yswd8tMK0C8ff?usp=sharing)

Not that running the notebook on a hosted runtime may cause errors when solving the instances, so it may be better to run it on a local runtime.
